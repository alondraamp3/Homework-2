        <p>
          My name is Alondra Benitez. I am a first generation Mexican-American Souther California native. I was born and raised in San Gabriel, California before moving to Anaheim in 2019. The San Gabriel Valley is one of the most densely Asian populated regions in the country, making for a great experience growing up as I got to learn so much about my friends' cultures which are very different than my own Mexican heritage. I also appreciate the aspects where our different cultures coincide, like our interpretations of Day of the Dead. There wasn't much to do in San Gabriel except go to boba shops or hit the closest mall to us. In the summer of 2019, my family relocated to Orange County.  It was hard having to leave the district I grew up in for senior year, especially when the pandemic hit during second semester before senior activities began. I was in a new place I couldn't even explore because everything had shut down. We all tried to make the best of what we could, and my humble brag is I've never gotten COVID.

          Given that my parents have their own business, I learned how to do office work from a young age. I would help file employee information, organize pay stubs, deposit checks, among other tasks. I got my first job outside of working with my parents when I was 16 at the Hot Topic store at my local mall. I worked in retail greeting customers, ringing them up at the register, and keeping the store organized. I started my second job during the pandemic in September of 2020. I started working as a swim instructor at Mission Viejo Swim School. I quickly began to climb the ladder and within a few short months I had been promoted to Supervisor. I grew a lot in just under two years. I am especially proud of having been invited to Mexico City with my director to open a business relationship with Nelson Vargas Family Fitness, the only Mexican chain of swim schools. I've always enjoyed working with customers and getting to know different people. Whether it was running into my 6th grade math/biology teacher at Hot Topic or meeting families from all over the world who came to swim specifically at Mission Viejo Nadadores. My work ethic is so strong thanks to my parents showing us that hard work is necessary to grow and do better.
